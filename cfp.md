# Manuscript Culture during the Revolution

This paper presents Digital Scholarly Editions of entertainment novels in manuscript form created during China's Cultural Revolution in the 1960s.

## Abstract
The conceptual tools of manuscript studies have their traditional root in the study of medieval European objects. Clandestinely produced and circulated manuscripts of entertainment fiction (手抄本 **shouchaoben**) played an important role in the transmission of literature in the PRC. Our editions intend to make these works available to researchers interested in the textual heritage of PRC literature. Our choice of sources allows us to critically explore editorial tools and concepts that are at odds with non-Western and contemporary sources.

We will discuss the unique role of **schouchaoben** literature, in the history of reading in China. This includes the larger genre, what books were most likely to circulate in this form, their producers, and the collection of sources we intend to publish. Using the relatively short **Three Times to Nanjing** as a case study, we present our semi-automated workflow for creating and publishing a tei-xml edition of a CJK manuscript. We pay special attention to those areas where East-Asian codicological conventions are poorly covered by existing markup standards, and how to address these shortcomings.
